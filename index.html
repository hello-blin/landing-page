            It is our responsibility to be an important, but silent, partner helping people rise and industries thrive.
            We are always there, quietly doing our job - refueling markets by providing access to reliable energy ecosystems towards a greener future.

                The entire LNG supply chain, from liquefaction to transportation to regasification, has become radically
                cleaner year after year. Our technology group is developing several new technologies, such as fuel-based
                ship supply systems and other similar solutions that will have a significant impact on global emissions.

                In a growing economy, clean and reliable energy is critical. The energy challenge of the 21st century is
                to provide basic, modern services to billions of people while also participating in clean, low-carbon
                systems.

                After years of dedication, we have arrived at a revolutionary point in the energy sector. There will be
                a significant increase in LNG export in the coming years as well as a clear demand from industry, power,
                home, and vehicle owners for clean, competitive fuel.

                At AG&P, we are constructing a major utility in India to provide clean fuel for cars in the form of
                compressed natural gas (CNG), LNG for industrial customers, and clean pipe natural gas for people's
                homes, all while replacing more expensive and much dirtier fuels.
